    "## What is OpenZeppelin? \n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a library for writing secure Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n",
    "- You can use it to build decentralized applications, protocols and organizations\n",
    "- It's a library written in the Solidity Programming Language\n",
    "- Solidity is the Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible language for writing smart contracts\n",
    "- Solidity compiles down to EVM bytecode, thats why a more popular language isn't well-suited for it\n",
    "- More popular programming languages like C++ and Python have constructs better suited for comping down to regular bytecode\n",
    "- Its meant to provide secure, tested and community-audited code\n",

    "## Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenZeppelin integrates with Truffle, an Ethereum development environment. \n",
    "- Install NPM if you haven't from here https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm \n",
    "- To Install Truffle using NPM and initialize your project, enter the following commands in terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "npm install -g truffle\n",
    "mkdir myproject && cd myproject\n",
    "truffle init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To install the OpenZeppelin library, run the following in your Solidity project root directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "npm init -y\n",
    "npm install -E openzeppelin-solidity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenZeppelin does not currently follow semantic versioning. \n",
    "- You may encounter breaking changes upon a minor version bump. \n",
    "- Pin the version of OpenZeppelin you use, as done by the -E (--save-exact) option.\n",
    "- After that, you'll get all the library's contracts in the node_modules/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts folder. \n",
    "- You can use the contracts in the library like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol';\n",
    "\n",
    "contract MyContract is Ownable {\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
